#' Strength Training Dose and Estimated 1RM
#'
#' This data set is used in Jovanovic, M. (2020) and it is generated for the purpose of demonstrating
#'     one particular method of dose-response modeling. It represents strength training dose for N=10
#'     athletes over 90 days. Training dose is represents with total upper- or lower- number of lifts
#'     (\code{UBNL}, \code{LBNL}), while the training response is represented with estimated 1RM variable
#'     (\code{est1RM}). Additional variables in this data set are \code{workout} (either Total, Lower, Upper
#'     or Off) and \code{type} indicating training stress (easy, medium, hard).

#' @format Data frame with 900 observations and 8 variables:
#'   \describe{
#'    \item{athlete}{Factor with 10 levels, indicating athlete names}
#'    \item{day}{Integer vector, indicating training day, from 1 to 90}
#'    \item{workout}{Factor with 4 levels, indicating type of training session: Total, Lower, Upper and Off}
#'    \item{type}{Factor with 4 levels, indicating training stress: Easy, Medium, and Hard}
#'    \item{UBNL}{Integer vector, indicating upper body number of lifts in a session.
#'    This represent the training dose}
#'    \item{LBNL}{Integer vector, indicating lower body number of lifts in a session.
#'    This represent the training dose}
#'    \item{est1RM}{Numeric vector, indicating estimated 1RM, or the training response}
#'    \item{est1RMchange}{Numeric vector, indicating day-to-day change in \code{est1RM}}
